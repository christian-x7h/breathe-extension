# Breathe Extension

This is a Chrome Manifest v3 extension inspired by [OneSec](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/one-sec-better-screen-time/id1532875441).

It works by letting you define a custom list of domains you want to intercept. Once defined, any time you attempt to open a URL that matches a domain in the list, a ~10 second interstitial is triggered. At the end of the interstitial, you are given the option to either close the tab or to continue to the original URL. You are also shown a counter of the number of times you have tried to open the page that day.
